# Audio-processing-toolkit
Audio processing toolkit which will allow audio filtering using a Fourier transform, short time Fourier transform or a continous wavelet transform. It can also support frequency shifting for voice modulation and volume normalisation throughout a recording.

## Aims:

* To accept an audio file input with some python audio libraries
* To copy this into an array (numpy array?)
* To see the frequency information in the array via FFT (in numpy)
* To plot the frequency information in the array with Matplotlib
* To use a FIR filter to remove background noise in the sound in the frequency domain
* Use cross-correlation (multiplication of the FFTs) of two independent microphones to reduce noise
* To run a CWT, with the PyCWT library
* Display the results with Matplotlib (as an image)
* To compare FIR filters to a filter made with a CWT with the PyCWT library
* Use CWT to find "low energy" parts of the spectrum and remove these from the result, assumes low energy = noise
* create a "sound profile" of speach and then filter outside this with a CWT to remove background noise eg road (low frequencies)
* Create basic GUI using PyQT5 library to display graphical output, enable options, load files etc
* Do analysis of data according to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis#Analytical_activities_of_data_users
* Aim to classify different kinds of sounds eg men and women employing these methods
* 

## Coding organisation:

* Aim to associate data with their associated functions within a class to better organise the code as it grows
* Class heirarchies with inheritance.
* sndLoad( file ) # loaded into data
* sndPlay( data )
* sndDownSample( data ) # Reduce sampling rate
* sndPadZeros( data ) # FFT() is faster on 2^N length arrays so add zeros to one end to the nearest 2^N
* FFT( data )   # decompose sound into sinusoid and cosine frequencies
* freqShift( data, absShift ) # can shift the sound up or down in frequency by absShift by multiplying the sound's frequency spectrum by a cosine wave
* volumeNorm( data, normMethod ) # detrends the data with respect to time, normMethod could be linear or some tailor expansion
* FIR_filter( data, windowFn, bandwidth, isHighPass, isLowPass )  # This is a filter on the FFT() output
* data is an array, windowFn is a window function to prevent high frequency "ringing", bandwidth is the width of the filter, isHighPass is a bool for if the filter will reduce low frequency amplitudes preserving high frequency amplitudes, isLowPass is a bool for if the filter will reduce high frequency amplitudes preserving low frequency amplitudes.
* IFFT( data ) # converts frequency information back into time information (sound)
* STFFT( data, dt, windowFn ) # Short time FFT() allows the frequencies to monitored as a fn of time, dt is the time interval, windowFn is the window function.
* plot( FFT( data ) ) # graphs the FFT information using Matplotlib
* CWT( data ) # shows how frequency information changes in time using a continuous wavelet transform method
* CWT_smooth( data, blurWidth ) # Apply blur of width blurWidth to CWT
* CWT_filter( data ) # use amplitude to filter, can use local amplitude density to filter too
* plot( CWT( data ) ) # Plots the frequencies present as a function of time

* **FIR filters are discussed here** **[READ FIRST]**: http://www.fourier-series.com/fourierseries2/FIR-filter.html
* Implemented using a FFT from numpy: http://www.scipy.org/ there are Faster FFT options to try later: https://github.com/hgomersall/pyFFTW # A FFTW python wrapper with a numpy dropin replacement, handy or SciPy's FFT seems faster than numpy's http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6365623/improving-fft-performance-in-python
* Performed FFT benchmarks in python with pyFFTW: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25527291/fastest-method-to-do-an-fft/36940788#36940788 and found the fastest interface to use.
* To measure the frequencies as a function of time we divide the signal, apply a "smoothing function" called a window function and then do a FFT:

* Graphing library in C++ in case that's too slow: http://www.qcustomplot.com/ which turns out to have some DIY python bindings of it's own https://github.com/dimV36/QCustomPlot-PyQt5  usage: http://developers-club.com/posts/260761/

* Discussion about normalisation and about Cython for speeding it all up: http://bastibe.de/2012-11-02-real-time-signal-processing-in-python.html
* Sound loading library: https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile
* There are easier alternatives for speedups such a Numba: http://numba.pydata.org/ which uses native python code, another native python compiler which doesn't need code alterations and works well with numpy etc looks most ideal, obviously we need to benchmark all. This is http://nuitka.net/

## Machine learning ideas list
**Sound is big data in the time-frequency domain**

* Clustering analysis in python: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_cluster_iris.html
* Machine learning/ statistical analysis: "The Elements of Statistical Learning", Springer, Trevor Hastie, 2013
* Machine learning, model validation, data error to model error analysis are all key.
* Python machine learning: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/ tutorials too: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html as well as a flow chart to help you decide what component you need: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
* Perhaps we can aim to use some of each component for something eg man vs woman clustering with unlabelled data and classification once they are labelled. Predicting a quantity such as delay time between two sound signals in high noise from a cross-correlation. Dimensionality reduction could be some sort of compression or noise removal technique in the frequency domain?
* Individual component analysis looks interesting: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/statistical_inference/unsupervised_learning.html#independent-component-analysis-ica
* Clustering could be a novel way to isolate signal from noise by similarity in the frequency domain.
* Emotion classification could be interesting, if a little scary!
* Prediction of an individual's pattern of speach to identify possible background noise, period of words, spectral content, amplitude etc.
